LibreHousehold breaks down into two subsystems with multiple modules as shown above. The arrows indicate logical dependencies between the modules. The squared boxes on the membrane of the subsystems indicate ports. Modules shown in both subsystems with the same name are responsible for the same topic and can be seen as one module split into two parts. These modules don't share any code but communicate via the defined ports.
