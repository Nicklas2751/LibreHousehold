= ADR 007: Svelte as Frontend Framework

== Context

A good frontend framework is needed to build the PWA frontend which is easy to use, has good performance, and a strong community.

== Considered Options

React; Vue; Angular; Svelte.

== Decision Outcome

Svelte is chosen as the frontend framework.
Angular is too complex for the needs of this project. React tends to mix HTML and JavaScript too much. Vue is a good option, but Svelte has a smaller bundle size and better performance.
The maintainer also has good experience with Svelte.
