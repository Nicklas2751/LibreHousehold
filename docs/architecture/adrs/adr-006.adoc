= ADR 006: Progressive Web App (PWA) for the Frontend

== Context

For the frontend a technology is needed which allows to build a modern app with a good user experience. Since the most users will use it on their mobile devices, it must be optimized for mobile use.

== Considered Options

Android & iOS native Apps; Flutter; Progressive Web App (PWA)

== Decision Outcome

The frontend will be implemented as a Progressive Web App (PWA). This allows to reach the most users with the least effort. The app can be used on any device with a modern web browser. No installation is needed, the app can be used directly from the browser. Users with technical background can host the app themselves xref:../chapters/01_introduction_and_goals.adoc#QG3[(QG3)]. JavaScript and TypeScript, the base of PWAs, are widely used and known by many developers. This makes it easy for new contributors to understand the code and to contribute xref:../chapters/01_introduction_and_goals.adoc#QG4[(QG4)]. There will be no app store costs and no need to go through the app store review process.

|Pros |Cons

2+^s|Native Apps
|
- Best performance
- Access to all device features
|
- High development effort (separate apps for Android and iOS)
- Users need to install the app
- Users need to update the app
- More difficult to contribute (different codebases for Android and iOS)
- The backend can be hosted anywhere, but the apps need to be published in the app stores (Google Play Store, Apple App Store).
- App store costs

2+^s|Flutter
|
- Single codebase for Android and iOS
- Good performance
- Access to most device features
|
- Users need to install the app
- Users need to update the app
- The backend can be hosted anywhere, but the apps need to be published in the app stores (Google Play Store, Apple App Store).
- App store costs

2+^s|Progressive Web App (PWA)
|
- Platform independent (runs on any device with a modern web browser)
- No installation needed
- Easy to update (updates are deployed on the server, no need for users to update the app)
- Easy to contribute (many developers know JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Users with technical background can host the app themselves xref:../chapters/01_introduction_and_goals.adoc#QG3[(QG3)]
- No app store costs
|
- Limited access to device features
- Slightly lower performance compared to native apps
