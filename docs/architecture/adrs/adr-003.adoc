= ADR 003: Modular division based on subject

== Context

The codebase need to be simple structured and easy to understand for new contributors to archive the maintainability quality goal xref:../chapters/01_introduction_and_goals.adoc#QG4[QG4].

== Decision Outcome

The codebase will be structured in modules based on subject. Each module should have a clear responsibility and should encapsulate all related functionality. This will make it easier for new contributors to understand the codebase and to find the relevant parts of the code.
