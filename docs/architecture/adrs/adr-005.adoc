= ADR 005: Spring Boot as backend framework

== Context

The backend needs a good basis to build upon. It should be a framework that is widely used, has a big community and is easy to use.

== Considered Options

Ktor; Spring Boot

== Decision Outcome

Spring Boot will be used as backend framework. It's very popular, has a big community and is easy to use. It also has a lot of integrations with other libraries and frameworks.
In difference with Ktor, Spring Boot is more mature and has a lot more features out of the box. Also, the documentation is a lot better and it directly supports Moduliths <<adr-004>>.
